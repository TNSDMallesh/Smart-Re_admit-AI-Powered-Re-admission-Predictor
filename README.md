## 📌 Project Overview

**Smart Re-admit** is a machine learning and deep learning-based project designed to predict whether a patient will be re-admitted to the hospital after discharge (particularly after 30 days). Leveraging Electronic Health Records (EHR), this system provides early warnings to healthcare providers for timely intervention.

> 🏥 Developed as a final year academic project at Sir C R Reddy College of Engineering under the mentorship of M. Ganesh Babu, Asst. Professor.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict patient re-admissions using structured healthcare data.
- Implement robust data preprocessing (missing value handling, encoding, scaling).
- Address class imbalance using **SMOTEENN**.
- Compare multiple models including **XGBoost, Random Forest, MLP, and LSTM**.
- Tune models using **RandomizedSearchCV**.
- Provide real-time predictions via **Streamlit web app**.
- Analyze top features influencing re-admission risk.

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: [UCI Diabetic Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008)
- Features: 35 (after cleaning) including:
  - Demographics (age, gender)
  - Visit details (number of inpatient visits, lab procedures)
  - Medications (insulin, metformin)
  - Diagnoses (diag_1, diag_2, diag_3)
- Target:
  - `1` = Re-admitted after >30 days
  - `2` = Not Re-admitted

## 🧪 Streamlit App Preview

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
## 🔄 Re-admission Prediction Process Overview

Here’s how the system works:

### 📥 Upload
User uploads a `.csv` file containing patient EHR (Electronic Health Record) data through the Streamlit interface.

### ⚙️ Preprocessing
- Missing values handled
- Categorical features encoded
- Feature scaling applied

### 🧠 Prediction
- Preprocessed data is passed through the trained **XGBoost model**

### 📊 Output
- Displays whether the patient is likely to be re-admitted:
  - `1` = Yes (Re-admitted after 30+ days)
  - `2` = No (Not re-admitted)
- Visuals such as **feature importance** charts are shown within the UI

✅ This process enables fast, reliable, and non-technical risk prediction for hospitals and care teams.

---

## 🔍 Results

### ✅ Best Model: XGBoost

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Accuracy:** 89.03%
- **Precision:** 88.50%
- **Recall:** 89.10%
- **F1-Score:** 88.80%
- **AUC Score:** 0.92

> High recall and F1-score indicate that the model performs well in detecting high-risk patients and minimizing false negatives.
